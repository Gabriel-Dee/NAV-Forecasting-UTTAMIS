## Introduction
Welcome to the Net Asset Value (NAV) Forecasting project! This project aims to forecast the NAV of various investment funds managed by UttaMIS, providing valuable insights for investors and financial institutions.

## Project Overview
- **Problem Statement:** Predict the future NAV of investment funds.
- **Dataset:** We utilize historical NAV data for multiple funds.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/net-asset-value-forecast.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the project's Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

## Data Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are selected. This ensures a high-quality dataset for modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Gain insights into the historical NAV data.
- Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
- Identify key features influencing NAV.

## Time Series Forecasting
- Utilize Time Series models like ARIMA for NAV forecasting.
- Tune model hyperparameters for accurate predictions.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results and Visualizations
- Present the forecasted NAV values against actual values.
- Visualize key trends and seasonal components for each fund.
- Interpret model performance and provide insights for investors.
